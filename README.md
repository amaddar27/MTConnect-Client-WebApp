# MTConnect-Client-WebApp

Using the Flask python library, this project aims to create a web application that is able to securely connect to MTConnect agents. It will be able to display and store historical data from the agent as well as providing key performance indicators such as utilisation and cycle times.
A user login system will also be implemented, as such users can remotely access their machine data.
